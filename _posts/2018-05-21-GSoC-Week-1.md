title: GSoC Week 1
---

This post walks through the advances I've made in my first week of GSoC. This week I've coded the classes for creating and manipulating graphs. I've added support for undirected graphs, directed graphs, multigraphs and multidigraphs.

This week was a hectic one as the target required pretty hefty coding. The PR [#15](https://github.com/athityakumar/networkx.rb/pull/13) is the result of this week's work. I'm still working on removing the rubocop offenses.

### Basic Graph Classses

* **Graph** - Given in `graph.rb`. Basic class for undirected graph.
* **DiGraph** - Given in `digraph.rb`. Basic class for directed graph. Inherits from **Graph**.
* **MultiGraph** - Given in `multigraph.rb`. Basic class for multigraph (undirected graph which can support more than one edge per pair of nodes). Inherits from **Graph**.
* **MultiDiGraph** - Given in `multidigraph.rb`. Basic class for multidigraph (directed graph which can support more than one edge per pair of nodes). Inherits from **DiGraph**.

As usual, those who want to get into more implementation level details and further details on my weekly plan may check my proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gUCa1LNPZmkKkqCEXR7eJu-IZ9DiiA-n0kG660hLIE/edit?usp=sharing).
